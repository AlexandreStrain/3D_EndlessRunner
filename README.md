# 3D_EndlessRunner
A game made and documented by Alexandre Strain for Real Programming 4 Kids to teach coding -- Completed, Customized and Personalized Version Only.
Project does not consist of any Proprietary Property such as the manuals I developed to teach how to build the game or any methodologies used by RP4K. This is the completed base version of the game all students get once they've completed the project - which I've since customized, personalized and will continue to move away from RP4K given assets. This project is simply my final version of the game code itself which cannot be copyrighted (as much as individual lines of code cannot be copyrighted) and all such processes used to teach this code have been removed and/or not included as agreed upon by both parties. Comments left in code are there to help me remember concepts for future projects of mine.

Note this project is and was intentionally written in a way that students aged 7-17 with varying experience levels can code and have fun. The project was designed as a starting framework and therefore purpose of each feature held the intent students would further develop on them long after the course was over. Later revisions of my version of this game will aim to complete it and move away from the original design.
