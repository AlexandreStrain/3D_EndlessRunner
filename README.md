# 3D_EndlessRunner
A game made by Alexandre Strain for Real Programming 4 Kids to teach coding -- Completed, Customized and Personalized Version Only. Project does not consist of any Proprietary Property such as the manuals to teach how to build the game or any methodologies used by RP4K. This is the completed version of the game all students get once they've completed the project - which I've since customized, personalized and will continue to move away from RP4K given assets. This project is simply my final version of the game code itself which cannot be copyrighted (as individual lines of code cannot be copyrighted) and all such processes used to teach this code have been removed and/or not included. Comments left in code are there to help me remember concepts for future projects of mine.
